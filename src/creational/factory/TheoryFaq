* One of the creational design patterns and it's widely used in JDK as well as frameworks like Spring and Struts

* Used when we have a super class with multiple sub classes and based on input we need to return one of the sub classes

* Takes the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program to factory class

* Also known as Factory Method Design Pattern

Advantages
----------
* Provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation
* Removes the instantiation of actual implementation class from client code

Factory Pattern example in JDK
------------------------------
* java.util.Calendar, ResourceBundle, NumberFormat getInstance() methods
* valueOf() method in wrapper classes
