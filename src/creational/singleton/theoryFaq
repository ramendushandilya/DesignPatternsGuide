* Java singleton pattern is one of the GOF patterns and comes under creational pattern

* Singleton patterns restricts the instantiation of class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the JVM

* Used for Logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool

* Also used in other patterns like abstract factory, builder, prototype, facade etc

Approach
--------
* To implement singleton pattern we have different approaches but all of them following common concepts
    . Private constructor to restrict the instantiation of the class from other classes
    . Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the class
    . Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the global access point four outer worlds to get the instance of the singleton class
