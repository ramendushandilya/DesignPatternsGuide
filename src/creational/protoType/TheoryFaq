* Prototype pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customised as per requirement

* This pattern should be followed if the cost of creating new object is expensive and resource intensive

* This pattern mandates that the object which you are copying should provide the copying feature


Advantages
----------
* Reduced the need of subclassing
* Hides complexity of creating objects
* Client can get new objects without knowing which type object it will be
* It lets you add or remove objects at runtime

Usage
-----
* When the classes are instantiated at run time
* When the cost of creating an object is expensive or complicated
* When you want to keep the number of classes minimum in an application
* When the client application needs to be unaware of object creation and representation
